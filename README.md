# Gliss
Gliss is aimed to be an all in one Minecraft speedrunning program. It is currently in development and use of it in it's current state may make your run ***UNVERIFIABLE***. So we do *NOT* reccommend it for use unless you are testing around.

## Prerequisites
Gliss requires for you to have a [Node.js LTS 16+](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
